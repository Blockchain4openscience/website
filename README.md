# blockchain4openscience.com
We are keeping the website here, this is for http://blockchain4openscience.com/ and not the git page. The website is general, the git page is specific expanding o issues/products/software/models/etc. The website will link to git pages and git pages will go to specific repositories. From a general audience, covered by http://blockchain4openscience.com/ all the way to a very specific more technical audience needing git repos; the middle ground is covered by git pages. We dont yet have any git page, so right now it will be more from the web to the repos. as we grow, we will, IMHO, have the structure that I just described earlier in this doc. the purpose of http://blockchain4openscience.com/ is just to present the effort with general easy for everyone to understand.
