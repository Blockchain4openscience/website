            <h1>Why blockchain4openscience.com</h1>
            <p>Data-driven discovery, a.k.a knowledge discovery, in the biomedical domain has shifted from cross-referencing databases to issues ranging from the reconstruction of maps for protein-protein interaction to the discovery of hidden connections from information embedded in the literature. It requires an intelligent layer upon which knowledge discovery mechanisms make use of structured and well-described data. Data per se is useful if it interoperates with other datasets, thus enhancing our capacity to relate datasets in order to answer biomedical questions. Being able to associate and discover is one aspect; there is also the need to conduct experiments, support collaboration and facilitate experimental reproducibility. Recent efforts in translational research and open science illustrate such necessities. The value of big data in open science is intrinsically related to that of linked data and semantics –the enabling technology for discoverability, share ability and reusability. Big data is meaningful for as long as it can be translated into insights that help us “hack” the systems producing such data.  </p>
